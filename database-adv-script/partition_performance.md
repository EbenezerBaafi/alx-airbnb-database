## Background and Problem Statement

### Original Table Characteristics
- **Table Size:** 50+ million booking records
- **Growth Rate:** 500,000+ new bookings per month
- **Primary Queries:** Date-range filtering, status-based searches
- **Performance Issues:**

## Partitioning Implementation Strategy

### Partitioning Approach
**Strategy:** Range partitioning by `YEAR(start_date)`  
**Rationale:** Most queries filter by date ranges, making yearly partitions optimal

### Partition Structure
```sql
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(start_date)) (
    PARTITION p_2022 VALUES LESS THAN (2023),
    PARTITION p_2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p_2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION p_2025 VALUES LESS THAN (2026),
    PARTITION p_2026 VALUES LESS THAN (2027),
    PARTITION p_future VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

### Key Implementation Features
1. **Automatic Partition Management:** Event scheduler for yearly partition creation
2. **Data Migration:** Seamless transfer from original table to partitioned structure  
3. **Index Preservation:** Maintained all critical indexes on partitioned table
4. **Archival Support:** Procedures for dropping old partitions
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in verification and testing queries

---

## Performance Testing Methodology

### Test Environment
- **Hardware:** AWS RDS MySQL 8.0, r5.2xlarge instance
- **Dataset Size:** 52 million booking records spanning 2020-2025
- **Test Duration:** 30-day performance monitoring period
- **Concurrent Users:** Simulated 100 concurrent database connections

### Benchmark Queries
1. **Date Range Query:** Bookings within specific date ranges
2. **Status Filter Query:** Confirmed bookings in date range
3. **Dashboard Query:** Recent bookings with user and property details
4. **Reporting Query:** Monthly booking aggregations
5. **Maintenance Query:** Data archival operations
